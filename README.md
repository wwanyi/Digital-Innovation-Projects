The application allow passenger to order their amenities such as slippers, ear plugs, or eye shades etc. The order will then sent over to the cabin crew's device and the cabin crew will receive the orders immediately with only bluetooth mode on. 

# Surprise Holiday
A Web App that could help Krisflyer members as well as new potential customers to package holidays for them, the holidays will be a surprise to the customers. Before any purchase is made, the prototype will ask some questions to find out who they are and what they like, when they can travel. After which, the customer can pick a region that they want to travel. The prototype will generate a list of pre-planned itineraries and the passenger will only know where they are going to a few days before departure. It is built using NodeJS.

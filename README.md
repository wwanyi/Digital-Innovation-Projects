# Digital-Innovation-Projects
KrisLab in Singapore Airlines is a space where employees can submit their ideas and develop them into prototypes they can call their own. These prototype are used and explored by the KrisLab team as digital initiatives. Below are some of the projects which I have contributed to. Idea may or may not gets adopted after the prototyping stage.

# IoT Devices for Room Usage
DIY ultrasonic motion sensor that detects human motion in a room/ place for counting people entering/ leaving their room. Sensor connects straight to the private IoT cloud platform. 
User can book/ monitor vacancies on a real-time status and exporting data for analytics. 
This solution reduces the number of meeting rooms being booked but is actually not in use.

# Flight Information Display System
Hybrid application running on an iOS/ Android platform that portrays the flight information through a QR code scanning. Each flight ticket has a unique QR code. Passenger can scan the code and information of their flights will be retrieved without having to look at the Display in the Airport.

# Child Friendly App
